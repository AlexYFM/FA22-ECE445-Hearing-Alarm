VID_20221030_153623.mp4 -- Verifying that basic programming worked. Basic blinker code. 

VID_20221030_212021.mp4 -- Getting USB communication from the chip to my laptop working. Warning: video has sound coming from music I was listening to. 

IMG_20221106_111339.jpg -- View of the development board with LED on. 

IMG_20221106_111341.jpg -- View of the development board with LED off. As of this update, the LED's state at any moment doesn't mean anything, but the change from on to off or off to on represents the completion of one audio value sample being processed and sent to the USB port. 

pcb 10_26.png, schematic 10_26.png -- Fairly self-explanatory; these are the updated version of the PCB and schematic.
