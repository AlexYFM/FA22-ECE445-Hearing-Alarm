Adding equations from final draft of design document.
LEP'd equation: $8h=Leq+10log((T_2-T_1)/T_n)$ dB. From http://www.larsondavis.com/learn/industrial-hygiene/noise-dosimetry-terminology.
Percent of Daily Dose = D = 100(C1 / T1 + C2 / T2 + Cn / Tn). From https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.95AppA#:~:text=If%20the%20dose%20as%20read,accumulated%20dose%20in%20percent%20exposure.
T equation: $T = \frac{8}{2^{(L-90)/5}}$. Used to calculate dB error. From same osha source.
