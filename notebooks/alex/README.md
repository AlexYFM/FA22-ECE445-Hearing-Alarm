## 09/26 Design Document Check
In this meeting, only I attended due to some virtual/in-person confusion in the case of Jinzhi and a work trip in South Africa for Jake.

The main topic we went over was how our project was unique/useful: they pointed out that the user-friendly warning lights and frequency buckets for the sound report would be good distinguishers for us, as most products at a similar price (<$100) only show instant dB values. Also obviously the price difference between us and industry grade SPL dosimeters would be a big thing.

Also we went over how a few more plots and calculations would be nice. One thing that they pointed out that I liked was adding some calculations to the tolerance analysis part, specifically that we could do X instructions within Y cycles and capture 20Hz-20kHz due to the amount of instructions being pretty low and the speed of our microcontroller being pretty fast - obviously specify in the doc.

One last thing that they pointed out is that for our R/V tables, we want to make sure that each requirement isn't a spec but rather a reflection of our high-level requirements.
